# Organization

I try to get all the students working with me to think about how to organize their work.
If they work in R -- and many of them do -- then I ask them to use the
R package [workflowr](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/index.html) to help them
organize their work. If you want to work with me you should read [Blischak et al](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.20843.1 which describes the ideas 
behind this package. Even if you do not use R, the ideas may help
you develop your own workflow. 

# Research 

Here are reading lists on some topics of interest:
